## 1. Overview
This collective report summarizes the qualification activities across all active work packages: `WP001`, `WP002`, and `WP003`, focused on HVAC and Cleanroom system validation.

## 2. Objectives
- Ensure qualification readiness and compliance with GMP requirements for HVAC and cleanroom environments.
- Capture traceable, protocol-driven CQV lifecycle across all WP streams.

## 3. Traceability
- All tasks and structures adhere to ISPE Baseline Guide Vol. 5 and EU GMP Annex 15.
- Individual WP traceability maintained with structured task IDs and metadata.

## 4. Tasks

## 5. Risks
- Schedule pressure on qualification streams running in parallel
- Alignment gaps between Engineering and CQV readiness

## 6. Evidence
- Protocols, reports, and supporting documentation stored under validated document control SOP

## 7. Status
- All WPs structured, with tasks planned and assigned
- Execution pending; active monitoring advised

## 8. Next Steps
- Monitor all task progress
- Capture deviations, ensure alignment with lifecycle requirements
- Finalize execution and close each WP accordingly
